  <h2>🎬Plot and Themes</h2>

    As the Ministry of Magic denies Voldemort’s return, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) finds himself 
    discredited and watched. Appointed by Minister Cornelius Fudge, the authoritarian Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) 
    suppresses defensive magic lessons. In response, Harry secretly trains fellow students—forming 
    “Dumbledore’s Army”—to fight the coming darkness. The story culminates in a confrontation at the 
    Department of Mysteries, where tragedy cements Harry’s resolve against Voldemort.

  <h2>🧩Production and Style</h2>
  <p>
    Yates made his franchise debut here, introducing a darker, more politically charged tone. Michael Goldenberg 
    adapted Rowling’s longest novel into the shortest Potter film, emphasizing character growth over subplots. 
    Nicholas Hooper’s restrained score and Warner Bros.’ visual effects team delivered moody, blue-gray 
    cinematography reflecting Harry’s isolation and rebellion.

  <h2>🎭Cast and Performances</h2>
  <p>
    Alongside Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson reprise their roles as Ron and Hermione. Imelda Staunton’s 
    portrayal of Umbridge drew wide praise for combining comic primness with menace, while newcomers like Evanna 
    Lynch (Luna Lovegood) were celebrated for faithful characterizations. Veterans such as Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, 
    and Helena Bonham Carter rounded out the ensemble.

  <h2>🌟Reception and Legacy</h2>

    Critics commended Yates for balancing spectacle with emotional maturity, yielding a 78% approval on Rotten Tomatoes 
    and a 7.5/10 rating on IMDb. The film earned two BAFTA Film Awards nominations and nearly $1 billion globally. 
    It is often credited with steering the series toward its darker, more politically resonant final chapters.
