\# Harry Potter HTML Website 🧙‍♂️



A simple multi-page HTML website based on the :contentReference\[oaicite:1]{index=1} — built to demonstrate core HTML concepts (structure, formatting, images, links, meta tags, etc).



---



\## 🔎 Overview



This project contains a set of linked webpages:



\- \*\*HarryPotter.html\*\* — Main page for the series overview  

\- \*\*HP1.html\*\*, \*\*HP2.html\*\*, … \*\*HP72.html\*\* — Subpages, each dedicated to a specific film in the series  

\- \*\*Imgs/\*\* — Folder containing images used across pages  



The website shows how basic HTML tags and HTML-only structure can be used to build a clean, multi-page site without any external framework or libraries.



---



\## 🛠️ Built With



\- HTML5  

\- Basic CSS styling (inline or simple)  

\- Git \& GitHub (version control + repository)  



No additional dependencies or build tools required — just a browser to view the pages.
